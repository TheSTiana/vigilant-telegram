# Sentiment analysis from social media

### Introduction

### Goals
- Construct sentiment analysis models based on the NLP techniques of fastai. 
- Gain solid experience with the objectives, challenges, and pitfalls of this approach to sentiment analysis.
- Optional: Dig into more recent developments in NLP, specifically the use of Transformers, using the HuggingFace library.

### Methods and materials

A major part of the project is to investigate a variety of data sets, as this is the best way to gain solid, generalizable experience. Here are some existing data sets to get you started (you should look for additional data sets yourself):
- [Amazon Review Data](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). See also URLs.AMAZON_REVIEWS and URLs.AMAZON_REVIEWS_POLARITY in fastai
- [Twitter US Airline Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)
- [Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment)
- [OpinRank Review Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/opinrank+review+dataset)

You are encouraged to construct your own data set by scraping one or more relevant internet sources.
The Python libraries Beautiful Soup and Scrapy are worth investigating. Twitter is a relatively easy
source for data, perhaps combined with efficient techniques for data labeling, for example [Snorkel](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel).
